    <title>June is The Worst Month</title>

<h4> Why June Sucks</h4>
<p> June is the worst month of 2016. There have been a lot of bad things that have happened during this month. Basically this test webpage is a giant pity party.
The good thing is that I have to include a list and a photo. So I can whine and whine, then write a list of all the crappy stuff that has happened. And, it will
actually be me completing the assignment.</p>
<h4> List of Sh*&ty Stuff</h4>
<ol>
    <li> Work dramaaaaaaaaa </li>
    <li> The wheel fell off my car </li>
    <li> My rental car smells like cigarettes </li>
    <li> My grandpa died </li>
    <li> I accidentally murdered an unborn baby chicken</li>
    <li> Orlando </li>
    <li> The day I got back from my Grandpa's memorial service my dog threw up blood </li>
    <li> I had to put my dog to sleep </li>
    <li> Our non-broody hen went broody and smashed a baby chick the day before hatch day (Two down)</li>
    <li> Father's Day is the 10th anniversary of my Dad dying </li>
</ol>
<h4> Pity Party </h4>
<p> So there is my Pity Party list. I haven't been to work in a week. And I have also missed class. So I am having a hard time understanding the assignment.
    Which is frustrating. Because I like to understand everything. Always. Also, I have put a lot of work into making this class happen, and I want to be
    successful. So I hope this doesn't put me behind. There are probably more bad things that have happened in June, you can look for them <a href = "https://www.google.com/"> here.</a> I hope July will be better.
</p>
<h3> Good Things</h3>
<p> And now for something GOOD that is happening in June. The rest of the baby chicks are supposed to hatch tomorrow! </p>
